# Code-Samples


Hi welcome to my github, here you can find my code samples.

### Python + Computer Networking
Check out my [Multi-Connection Web Server](https://github.com/jdillonh/Multi-Connection-Web-Server) that manages multiple TCP and UDP connections on a single thread with blocking-queue.

Also see my [Maniplative DNS Proxy](https://github.com/jdillonh/Manipulative-DNS-Proxy) that handles UDP and TCP DNS connections, that fields DNS requests by forwarding them upstream to an exisisting resolver and redirects 404's to a given website.
