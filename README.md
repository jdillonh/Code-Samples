# Code-Samples


Hi welcome to my github, here you can find my code samples.

### webGL
See [this example](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jdh7077/webgl/webgl_example.html) of some webGL on my website. 


### Python 
#### Computer Networking
Check out my [Multi-Connection Web Server](https://github.com/jdillonh/Multi-Connection-Web-Server) that manages multiple TCP and UDP connections on a single thread with a blocking-queue.

Also see my [Maniplative DNS Proxy](https://github.com/jdillonh/Manipulative-DNS-Proxy) that handles UDP and TCP DNS connections, that fields DNS requests by forwarding them upstream to an exisisting resolver and redirects 404's to a given website.

Here's a simple internet connection logging tool that keeps track of when you computer goes online/offline and sends notifications to the MacOS Desktop [Internet Connection Logger](https://github.com/jdillonh/Internet-Logger/).

#### Datastructure

See my Python [Trie](https://github.com/jdillonh/python-trie) ("lookup tree") for a datastructure example.

### LineLibrary
This is a project I did for a startup called LineLibrary. The company plans to change the way sports betting is done by creating an open exchange where users can buy and sell bets buring a game. My [simulator](https://github.com/jdillonh/LineLibrarySim) is an example of what the UI and UX might look like, built on Love2D with my own UI elements library.

### Personal Projects 
#### Lua + Games
Take a look at [*Bloink*](https://github.com/jdillonh/bloink-game) a game I made with the Love2D framework.
I also have a few [libraries](https://github.com/jdillonh/love2d-libs) for the Love2D framework that I use in my games.

#### Processing 3 (Java)
I also like to make sketches in Processing 3, see some 
[here](https://github.com/jdillonh/shadows) and 
[here](https://github.com/jdillonh/squares).

### Not what you're looking for?
If there is something you would like to see I am happy to share other code that I have written or write something new and share it with you directly. (Much of the code I write for school can't be posted here for reasons of academic integrity)

I am currently doing work in Python, and JavaScript + WebGL, and have worked in C++ and C# in the past.
